# ACTIVE — Finish v2 chunking + embedding for all remaining v1 thoughts

**State (2026-05-17)**: 58 v2 / 238 = ~24% coverage. **180 v1 thoughts remain.** Process in batches of 20 by `effective_date desc` (script default since today). Each batch ~$1.50–$3, ~10–18 min.

**Run**: `node scripts/reprocess-v2-prototype.js 20` on Hetzner (defaults skip-v2 + effective_date-desc).
**Retry failed**: `node scripts/retry-failed-reprocess.js <id1> <id2> ...` (has empty-chunk fallback).

- [ ] Batch 4: next 20 by effective_date desc (~$2, ~12 min) → 78 v2 / 238
- [ ] Batch 5: 20 more → 98 / 238
- [ ] Batch 6: 20 more → 118 / 238
- [ ] Batch 7: 20 more → 138 / 238
- [ ] Batch 8: 20 more → 158 / 238
- [ ] Batch 9: 20 more → 178 / 238
- [ ] Batch 10: ~20 remaining (final tail) → 198 / 238 (the rest may be archived/odd; live with it or final sweep)

**Total budget remaining (~180 thoughts)**: ~$15–25 Sonnet 4.6, ~2–3 hours wall-clock (with breaks between batches).
**Per-batch checklist**: run → check failures → retry → next batch. Don't queue multiple batches blind.

**When to stop**: when search recall feels right OR coverage hits ~90%. Final 5–10% may be archived / pure-test thoughts not worth $2.

# P14 prototype — 20-thought reprocess with chunking + multi-vector

**Goal**: take 20 most recent thoughts, in-place reprocess: re-Haiku with fresh ERSTE-split vaultCtx → generate summary + topic chunks → embed each chunk as separate Qdrant point with `parent_id` link. Measure pain-query improvement before/after.

## Architecture decisions (locked)

- **Multi-vector storage**: separate Qdrant points per chunk, `payload.kind = 'chunk'` + `payload.parent_id = <thought_id>`. Thought point stays at its own id with `payload.kind = 'thought'` (or absent). Same `thoughts` collection.
- **Main thought vector**: `embedText(summary)` — not the original truncated text. Cleaner semantics, better recall on long thoughts.
- **Haiku call structure**: ONE mega-prompt per thought returns JSON: `{ metadata, summary, summary_chunks[], content_chunks[] }`. No 4-way fan-out.
- **Scope**: 20 most recent by `created_at` desc. No source filter.
- **Mode**: in-place. No backup. We accept the risk; rollback for Fireflies/Gmail = re-fetch from source.
- **UI**: chunk hits show label inline ("Bizi adattisztítás — *captcha hard gate*"). Click → full thought modal.
- **Pipeline marker**: every modified thought + every new chunk point gets `pipeline_version: 'v2'` for find/cleanup.

## Pre-flight

- [ ] **Fix typo**: `ERSET Market.md` → `ERSTE Market.md` (user confirms or skips)
- [ ] **Define success metric**: lock 7 pain queries before running. Save current top-10 + scores to `tasks/v2-baseline.json`. Suggested queries:
  1. `ERSTE Adform SZA frissítés 150e kaphatsz uj template új feed`
  2. `Bizi captcha hard gate egyeztetés`
  3. `customBrain dev next steps`
  4. `ERSTE Cseperedő számla status`
  5. `Amundi follow-up`
  6. `Telex adaptive AV csomag`
  7. `Pörköláb David Erste programmatic`

## Implementation

### Step 1 — Haiku mega-prompt module (~45min)

- [ ] New file: `server/reprocess-v2.js`
- [ ] Function: `reprocessThought(text, vaultCtx)` → `{ metadata, summary, summary_chunks, content_chunks }`
- [ ] Single Anthropic Haiku call with JSON-mode prompt. Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "metadata": { "title": "...", "type": "...", "projects": ["MOST SPECIFIC sub-project"], "people": [...], "topics": [...], "action_items": [...] },
    "summary": "<chronological, ≤6000 chars, full content compressed>",
    "summary_chunks": [ { "label": "...", "text": "..." } ],
    "content_chunks": [ { "label": "...", "text": "..." } ]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Prompt rules:
  - Project tagging: MUST pick the most specific sub-project (e.g., `ERSTE Számlák`, not `ERSTE`, when SZA/Cseperedő/Online számla/Diák referenced)
  - Aliases injected from vaultCtx (existing pattern)
  - Summary: < 6000 chars, kronológikus, kép tükrözi a tartalom dátumát ne a capture dátumot
  - summary_chunks: 2-5 chunks témánként, mindegyik ≤ 1500 char
  - content_chunks: 2-10 chunks fordulópontonként, mindegyik ≤ 2000 char
  - If thought is short and single-topic: return one chunk in each array
- [ ] Test the prompt manually on 1 thought first (the Varfi email) — confirm output JSON parses + makes sense

### Step 2 — Reprocess script (~30min)

- [ ] New file: `scripts/reprocess-v2-prototype.js`
- [ ] Fetch 20 most recent thoughts from Qdrant (ordered by `created_at` desc)
- [ ] For each:
  1. `getVaultContext()` — full vault with new ERSTE split
  2. `reprocessThought(text, vaultCtx)` → JSON output
  3. `embedText(summary)` → main vector
  4. `embedText(chunk.text)` for each chunk (parallel batch)
  5. Qdrant ops:
     - `updatePoint(thought_id, { vector: main_vec, payload: { ...new_metadata, text: summary + original, has_v2_summary: true, summary_appended_at: now, pipeline_version: 'v2' } })`
     - `upsertPoints(chunk_points)` — N new points with `kind: 'chunk'`, `parent_id`, `chunk_label`, `chunk_text`, `chunk_kind: 'summary'|'content'`, `pipeline_version: 'v2'`
  6. Log: `[ID] N chunks created, project: X→Y, cost: ~$0.02`
- [ ] Total expected cost: ~$0.50

### Step 3 — Search rollup (~30min)

- [ ] Edit `server/routes/search.js`:
  - `searchVector(query_vec, limit=30)` — over-fetch
  - Rollup: for each result, if `payload.kind === 'chunk'` group by `parent_id`, keep best-score chunk + chunk_label
  - Fetch parent thought payload for display
  - Return top-N with optional `matched_chunk_label`
- [ ] Edit `server/qdrant.js`:
  - `getRecent` — filter `must_not: kind=chunk`
  - `getStats` — filter `must_not: kind=chunk` for thought count; add separate chunk count
  - `getConnectionStats` (hygiene) — filter `must_not: kind=chunk`

### Step 4 — UI chunk-label display (~15min)

- [ ] Edit `client/src/components/Search.jsx`:
  - If result has `matched_chunk_label`, show below title: `<span className="chunk-label">↳ {matched_chunk_label}</span>`
  - Tailwind: `text-xs text-txt-sec italic`

### Step 5 — Measure + report (~15min)

- [ ] Re-run the 7 pain queries, save to `tasks/v2-after.json`
- [ ] Diff baseline vs after: rank changes per query, score deltas
- [ ] Brief report: which queries improved, which didn't, which got worse

## Rollback (if prototype is worse)

- [ ] `scripts/rollback-v2.js`:
  - Delete all points where `payload.pipeline_version === 'v2'` AND `kind === 'chunk'`
  - For thoughts where `has_v2_summary === true`: cannot restore original text without backup, BUT Fireflies/Gmail re-fetchable via source_id, manual captures lost
- [ ] **Accept risk**: manual captures in the 20 may be permanently rewritten (text replaced with `summary + original`)

## Open question for user

- [ ] **Typo fix**: rename `ERSET Market.md` → `ERSTE Market.md` on Drive? (Or is "ERSET" intentional?)
- [ ] **Manual captures in the top 20**: if rewrite is a concern, we can SKIP `source === 'manual'` thoughts from the prototype (so original text stays untouched). Default plan = rewrite all 20.

## Definition of done

- 20 thoughts have `pipeline_version: 'v2'` and `has_v2_summary: true`
- Corresponding chunk points exist with `parent_id` matching
- 7 baseline queries re-run, delta report written
- Search UI shows chunk-labels on chunk-matched hits
- No regressions: `getRecent`, `brain_stats`, `find_overconnected`, `export` all work as before (chunk points filtered out)

# Hybrid search (P8) — BM25 sparse + dense + RRF — NEW 2026-05-17

**Status**: spec locked, waiting user confirm before implementation. Promoted from DEFERRED based on today's "Boris Cherny" probe (see ROADMAP P8 for evidence + decisions). Replaces the planned P14 A→B→C path.

## Decisions locked (in ROADMAP P8)

- Multilingual stemmer (HU + EN) for BM25 tokenization — **user confirmed 2026-05-17**
- `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` taskType on capture side (baked into the same re-embed pass)
- No cross-encoder reranker for v1
- No query-side taskType change (probed, no effect)
- No `title:` parameter (probed, hurts cross-language)

## Pre-flight (DONE 2026-05-17)

- [x] **Library choice**: custom BM25 + `snowball-stemmers` 0.6.0 (ISC, HU supported). User confirmed + correctly flagged that fastembed is SPLADE/neural-sparse (not lexical BM25) — would defeat the purpose.
- [x] **Qdrant capability**: 1.17.0 confirmed. Migration required, not in-place: current collection uses unnamed dense vector, can't mix with named sparse. Path: create `thoughts_v2` with named vectors `{ dense, bm25 }`, copy all points (596 total: 237 thoughts + 353 chunks + 6 archived) preserving dense vectors as-is + computing sparse, then swap collection name in config.
- [x] **IDF strategy**: use Qdrant native `modifier: "idf"` on the sparse vector — server-side IDF, stays in sync with collection. Client only sends TF.
- [ ] Lock baseline: capture current "Boris Cherny" + 7 pain queries → `tasks/p8-baseline.json`.

## Implementation

### Step 1 — Sparse encoder module (~1hr) — DONE 2026-05-17
- [x] New file: `server/sparse.js` — exports `sparseEncodeDoc(text)` (BM25 TF normalized) and `sparseEncodeQuery(text)` (raw TF, Qdrant applies IDF via `modifier: "idf"`). FNV-1a 32-bit stable term→index hash so indices survive restarts without persisted map.
- [x] Tokenize: lowercase + Unicode normalize + strip non-letter/number + stopword filter + HU stem (fall back to EN if HU unchanged).
- [x] Hungarian morphology verified: Cseperedő / Cseperedőt / Cseperedőnek all collapse to `cseperedő`.
- [x] Boris Cherny case verified: query→Cherny tweet dot=3.24 (2 shared stems), query→DCO transcript dot=0 (0 shared stems). Decisive separation before IDF even applies.
- [x] Installed `snowball-stemmers@0.6.0` in server/package.json.

### Step 2 — Schema migration (~30min) — SCRIPT DONE, RUN PENDING USER OK
- [x] Path decided: collection swap (existing `thoughts` has unnamed dense; Qdrant won't mix unnamed + named).
- [x] Wrote `scripts/migrate-to-hybrid-collection.js` — copies source → dest, preserves dense vectors, computes sparse from text/chunk_text, recreates 7 payload indexes. Supports `--limit N` for smoke testing, `--force` to recreate dest. Never touches source.
- [x] Smoke-tested on Hetzner with `--limit 5 --dest thoughts_v2_smoketest`: 5 points migrated cleanly, Qdrant Query API hybrid RRF returned ranked results, smoke collection then dropped.
- [x] Ran full migration 2026-05-17: all 596 points (243 thoughts + 353 chunks) → `thoughts_v2`. Source `thoughts` left untouched as rollback safety net.
- [x] Validated hybrid query on `thoughts_v2` against "Boris Cherny" + 7 P14 pain queries. Cherny case: hybrid puts target at 1.0000 vs #2 at 0.3333 — 3× lead, definitively fixes the originally reported bug. No regressions detected. Bizi captcha + Amundi also improved.
- [ ] Update `scripts/init-collection.js` to declare the new schema (for fresh installs going forward).

### Step 3 — Capture pipeline (~30min) — DONE 2026-05-17
- [SKIP] `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` taskType: deferred. Reason: would shift cosine ranges across old/new captures and invalidate the calibrated 0.85 conflict-detection threshold. Hybrid alone gets the Boris-Cherny win without this. Can be added in a separate pass with a full dense re-embed.
- [x] Edit `server/routes/capture.js`: import `sparseEncodeDoc`, compute sparse alongside dense in `captureThought` AND `refreshCapture`, pass both to `upsertPoint`.
- [x] Edit `scripts/reprocess-v2-prototype.js`: write `{dense, bm25}` named vectors for both main thought (using summary text) and every chunk.
- [x] Edit `server/qdrant.js::upsertPoint`: signature now `(denseVector, sparseVector, payload, id?)`.

### Step 4 — Search pipeline (~45min) — DONE 2026-05-17
- [x] Edit `server/qdrant.js`: added `hybridSearch(denseVec, sparseVec, limit)` using Query API with RRF prefetch (each leg over-fetches 4× the final limit). `searchVector` kept as dense-only for the conflict-detection path in capture (where lexical match would be wrong signal).
- [x] Edit `server/routes/search.js`: imports `sparseEncodeQuery` + `hybridSearch`, calls hybrid path. Existing `rollupChunkHits` + `applyTimeDecay` unchanged.
- [x] Edit `server/qdrant.js::getAllWithVectors`: unwraps `.dense` so consumers (Obsidian export, brain-health duplicates) stay back-compatible.

### Step 5 — Backfill (~30min wall-time, ~$1–3 dense cost)
- [ ] New file: `scripts/backfill-hybrid.js`.
- [ ] For every point in collection: compute sparse vector locally + re-compute dense with `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` (Gemini), single upsert with both vectors.
- [ ] Same for chunk points.
- [ ] Idempotent: safe to re-run. Print progress every 20 points.

### Step 6 — Verify (~15min)
- [ ] Re-run "Boris Cherny" search → tweet MUST be #1.
- [ ] Re-run 7 pain queries from baseline → save to `tasks/p8-after.json`, write delta report (rank changes + score deltas).
- [ ] Spot-check 3 Hungarian-morphology queries: "Cseperedő" should match "Cseperedőt", "Cseperedőnek"; "számla" should match "számlák", "számlát".

### Step 7 — Deploy + bump (~15min)
- [ ] Deploy to Hetzner (mandatory `pm2 stop all` + `fuser -k 3000/tcp` BEFORE `pm2 start`, per `feedback_hetzner_restart.md`).
- [ ] Bump `0.18.0` → `0.19.0` (minor: new payload field, behavioural change in ranking).
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry: "Hybrid search (BM25 sparse + dense + RRF) with HU+EN stemmer. Replaces pure-dense ranking. RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT taskType added to capture-side embeddings."

## Definition of done

- "Boris Cherny" returns Cherny tweet at #1 (currently #2 behind irrelevant DCO transcript).
- ≥4 of 7 P14 pain queries improved on top-10 placement vs baseline.
- No regressions in: `get_recent`, `brain_stats`, `find_overconnected`, vault export, agenda.
- New thoughts auto-write both vectors on capture.
- Backfill script left in `scripts/` for future use.

## Open questions for user before starting

1. **BM25 library**: custom + `snowball-stemmers` (recommended, ~50 LOC, MIT) — confirm?
2. **Migration path**: try add-in-place first, fall back to collection swap if Qdrant rejects — confirm?
3. **Order vs v2 chunking batches**: should we (a) finish v2 chunking batches 4–10 first (current ACTIVE work above), then hybrid, OR (b) pause batches and do hybrid now so each new chunk only gets embedded once with both vectors? My recommendation: **(b)** — finishing batches without sparse means a second backfill pass on those same chunks later. Doing hybrid first means all remaining batches write both vectors natively.
